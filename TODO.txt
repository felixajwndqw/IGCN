TODO

MNIST
x Change dropout value
x Implement weight regularisation
x Implement ability to run tests from cmd line
x Add rotation augmentation to MNISTrot
x Test augmentation params
x Pick best models from MNIST+rotation and validate results
x Select best model for MNISTRot and push for results
x Try with rotation augmentation for results comparison
x Grab results of other papers and organise by variation
Swap order of bnorm/relu
Add image pad>upsampling>rotation>downsampling and compare results
Rotate by set thetas - see if gabor filters align and if accuracy improves with more gabor filtes
Rotate by set thetas - make one orientation noisy and see if irregular number of filters align

GENERAL SEGMENTATION
Share gabor params along skip connections

ISBI
x Validation dataset
Select default model
Push for results
Lifted multicut post processing

BSD
x Implement me
x Treat GTs as probability maps and combine to form a weighted GT
Select default model
Push for results

CIRRUS
x Test hypothesis - Remove modulation and compare:
x Segmentation accuracy
Orientation regression accuracy

CIFAR
X Implement me

GENERAL
x Write methodology
x Create functionality to grab and plot filters/activations
x Implement complex weight initialisation
x Implement infrastructure for model insight experiments:
x Activation map stability to rotation transformations. 
    SSIM
    x Response Magnitude
    x T-SNE
Gabor parameters backprop
Make graph with c on x-axis and seg/reg performance on y axis






RANDOM
